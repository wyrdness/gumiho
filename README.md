# Gumiho (구미호)

## Overview
The gumiho is a legendary nine-tailed fox from Korean mythology, distinct from its Chinese (huli jing) and Japanese (kitsune) counterparts. In Korean folklore, the gumiho is traditionally portrayed as a malevolent creature that preys on humans, particularly targeting men. Unlike the potentially benevolent foxes of Chinese and Japanese traditions, Korean gumiho are almost universally depicted as dangerous predators that must consume human flesh or organs, especially livers or hearts, to survive or become human.

### Joseon Dynasty Records (1392-1897)

### Korean Shamanism (Muism)
In Korean shamanic tradition, the gumiho represents:
- The dangerous power of transformation and deception

- The consequences of unbridled desire and temptation

Shamans developed specific rituals to:

## Transformation Lore

### Becoming a Gumiho
According to traditional beliefs, a fox becomes a gumiho by:
- Living for one thousand years and gaining supernatural powers
- Absorbing energy from the sun and moon over centuries
- Consuming the spiritual essence of other creatures
- Surviving near sacred mountains or temples for extended periods

### The Path to Humanity
Some legends describe ways a gumiho might become human:
- Abstaining from eating human flesh for one thousand days
- Performing good deeds without being discovered
- Having their fox bead voluntarily swallowed by a human who survives
- Earning genuine love from a human who knows their true nature

However, most Korean traditions consider this transformation impossible, emphasizing the gumiho's irredeemably predatory nature.

## Detection and Protection

Traditional protective measures include:
- Carrying dog fur or dog teeth as talismans
